## Set-up
You should be viewing this document in RStudio. If you have not done so already, make sure to install ``rmarkdown`` and ``knitr``. You can do this by clicking the Install button in the Packages tab in the lower-right corner of RStudio and following the directions on the installation menu. You can also install packages by entering ``install.packages(x)`` into the R Console, where ``x`` is the name of the package.

## Instructions
This assignment will focus on the skills you have been developing in R over the first few weeks of this class. It will focus on the materials on data structures and the fundamentals of programming in R. Most of the code will be familiar after the lectures but you will encounter some new functions, so I encourage you to make use of the extensive documentation provided in RStudio and online. The assignment will also help to build familiarity with RStudio, RMarkdown, and Github.

This assignment will involve a combination of short written answers and coding in R.

**Please begin by adding your name to the top of the document on line 3.** Submission instructions are included at the end of this document.


## Using RMarkdown
This RMarkdown document contains a mixture of text (formatted using Markdown conventions) and R code "chunks". Each chunk contains a set of braces with some important information. For example, the chunk below is prefaced with ``{r preliminaries, include=FALSE}``. First, the ``r`` signifies that the chunk should be run using R. Second, ``preliminaries`` is the name of the chunk. This is followed by a set of options, separated by commas. In this case ``include=FALSE`` means that this code chunk will not be shown in any output. If we set it to ``TRUE`` then the chunk would be printed in any output.

```{r preliminaries, include=FALSE} 
# No need for any code here
```

In the first cell (lines 9-21) there are also some global options that alter the behavior of all code chunks. Look at the documentation [here](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#chunk-options). 

You can execute the code in a chunk by clicking the green arrow in the top right ("Run Current Chunk") or by using the keyboard shortcut.* You can also run individual lines by selecting the line or clicking at the beginning and using the keyboard shortcut.

*``Alt + Shift + K`` or ``Option + Shift + K``, depending upon your computer, will open up a menu showing the keyboard shortcuts available in RStudio.

#  Questions

Q1. For each of the following chunk options, explain what they do in one sentence (refer to the documentation linked above):
    a. echo: 
    b. warning:
    c. message:
    d. tidy:
    e. error:
    
Q2. Use the "Insert a new code chunk" button to insert a new chunk below this line. Add the same option as the previous chunk. Once you have created the chunk, create three variables: a character string, an integer, and a logical. You are free to choose the value of the variables and can name them anything you like.

Q3. In the chunk below, create a vector of numbers from 1 to 100, reverse the order of the vector, and print the last 5 values. 

**Note: I use the following symbol to comment out unfinished code: "####". In the examples below, make sure to delete this symbol to run the code and before submitting the assignment.**
```{r q3, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
####
```

Q4. Complete the code chunk below. Assign the first and last elements of the vector created in Q3 to the relevant names then print each object out using the ``print`` function.

```{r q4, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
#### first <- 
#### last <- 
```

Q5. a. Create a vector ``v`` of 10,000 values drawn from a normal distribution then calculate the mean and standard deviation using built-in functions. Then uncomment the last two line. These lines will print the values, rounded to two decimal places.
```{r q5a, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
#### v <- 
#### v.mean <-
#### v.sd <- 
#### print(round(v.mean), 2)
#### print(round(v.sd), 2)
```

Q5. b. Now create a new vector ``v.2`` of the same length as ``v``, where the mean and standard deviation are equal to 10. You may need to refer to the documentation to do this.
```{r q5b, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
#### v.2 <- 
#### v.2.mean <-
#### v.2.sd <- 
#### print(round(v.2.mean), 2)
#### print(round(v.2.sd), 2)
```

Q6. Combine the two vectors from Q4 and Q5 into a matrix with 10,000 rows and 2 columns. Print the first ten rows of the matrix using the ``head`` function.
```{r q6, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
####
```

Q7. a. Convert the matrix from Q6 into a data frame. Use the ``colnames`` function to assign the names ``x`` and ``y`` to the columns. 
```{r q7a, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
####
```

Q7. b. Next, use the ``$`` operator to select column ``y`` and print the twenty highest values.
```{r q7b, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
####
```

Q8. This question will focus on lists. In the example below we have conducted a series of flips of a fair coin and stored the results and other relevant information in a list, `q`. Do not modify the first two lines and do not use the parameter ``t`` in any of your code.

a. Print out the first ten elements of the ``trials`` element of ``q`` using only the square brackets notation for list indexing.

b. Do the same but make use of the ``$`` operator. Note that you may still need to use square brackets to index specific elements of ``trials``. 

c. Print the value of the variance of ``trials``, as stored in the ``stats`` element.

d. Assign the ``trials`` element as a new column in the data frame you created in Q6.
```{r q8, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
t <- rbinom(10000,1,0.50) # Do not modify
q <- list(trials = t, desc="10k_trials", timestamp = date(), stats = c(mean(t), var(t))) # Do not modify
#### Your code here
```

Q9. In the example below I have created a list to store information about various fruit, similar to the example discussed in lecture. The ``unlist`` command can be used to convert from a list to a vector. 

a. Find out the class of ``v``. In one sentence explain why it belongs to this class given that `fruit.count` contained both character and numeric content.

b. You will notice that this vector contains names, corresponding to the original element name and the position of the value in the original vector. You can use these names along with square brackets notation to extract specific elements from the vector. Use this method to print out the number of kiwis.
```{r q9, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
fruit.count <- list(fruits=c("apple", "orange", "pineapple", "kiwi"), counts=c(9, 4, 3, 12))
v <- unlist(fruit.count)
#### Your code here
```

Q10. In the following chunk we use a for-loop and an if-else statement to sort letters into vowels and consonants. Complete the missing code between the parentheses. You may need to use the help function (``?append``) to see how the append function works. 

```{r q10, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
letters <- LETTERS
vowels <- character()
consonants <- character()

for (l in letters) {
    if () { # Complete the conditional in parentheses
        vowels <- append(vowels, l) 
    } else {
        consonants <- append(consonants, l)
    }
}
```

Q11. Let's try using these vowels and consonants to create some new words using a very simple morphology. Each word is ``N`` letters long. We will create words using two simple rules: if the previous two characters are the same type (e.g. both consonants), pick a different type of letter; if the two previous letters are different types then pick one at random. 

Complete the for-loop and the conditional statements. I have included a series of print statements to help to show what the code is doing. You may need to use the ``%in%`` operator for the conditionals, see usage below.
```{r q11, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
N = 8 # word length 

word <- character() # this will hold our words
word[1] <- sample(LETTERS, 1) # sample 1 consonant at random for first letter
word[2] <- tolower(sample(LETTERS, 1)) # Note the lowercase function

for (i in 3:N) {
     print(i) # print the current index
     print(paste(word, collapse="")) # print current word
     if () { # Condition: Previous two letters are vowels
         word[i] <- tolower(sample(consonants, 1))
     } else if () { # Condition: Previous two letters are consonants
         word[i] <- tolower(sample(vowels, 1))
     } else { # Condition: Previous two letters are either vowels or consonants
         word[i] <- tolower(sample(LETTERS, 1))
     }
    print(paste(word, collapse="")) # print word with one more letter
}
```

Q12. If we want to re-use the code in Q11 then it is useful to make a function. Complete the code below to construct a function to output a random word of length ``N``, following the same rules as before. The function must return a single word  (i.e. not a vector of characters). You may copy and paste code from the previous question, but please make sure not to leave any print statements in the function body.
```{r q12, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
make.word <- function() { ### Add function arguments to the parentheses
    #### Your function body here
}

print(make.word(8))
print(make.word(10)) # run this to print a 10 letter word
``` 

Q13. Use the pipe operator (``%>%``) to re-write this nested set of functions. Note that you may need to supply arguments to some of the functions used in the pipe. You may also need to look up how to do some of the mathematical options using `magrittr`.

```{r q13, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
N <- 10000
X <- rnorm(N)

sqrt(sum(((X-mean(X))^2))/N)

```
